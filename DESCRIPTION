Description: Produce maximum likelihood estimates of common accuracy statistics
 for multiple measurement methods when a gold standard is not available. An R implementation of
 the expectation maximization algorithms described in *Statistical Methods
 in Diagnostic Medicine, Second Edition* (Zhou et al. 2011) with
 additional functions for creating simulated data and visualizing results. Supports
 binary, ordinal, and continuous measurement methods.
