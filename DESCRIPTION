Description: Produce maximum likelihood estimates of common accuracy statistics
 for multiple measurement methods when a gold standard is not available. An R 
 implementation of the expectation maximization algorithms described in Zhou et 
 al. (2011) <doi:10.1002/9780470906514> with additional functions for creating 
 simulated data and visualizing results. Supports binary, ordinal, and 
 continuous measurement methods.
