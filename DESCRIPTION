Description: Produce maximum likelihood estimates of common accuracy statistics
 for multiple measurement methods when using an imperfect gold standard. An R implementation of
 the expectation maximization algorithms described in *Statistical Methods
 in Diagnostic Medicine, 2nd Edition* \insertCite{Zhou_Obuchowski_McClish_2011}{emery} with
 additional functions for creating simulated data and visualizing results. Supports
 binary, ordinal, and continuous methods.
